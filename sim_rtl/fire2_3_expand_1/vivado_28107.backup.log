+----------------+------+-------+-----------+-------+
| Block RAM Tile |    0 |     0 |      1030 |  0.00 |

* Note: Each Block RAM Tile only has one FIFO logic available and therefore can accommodate only one FIFO36E1 or one FIFO18E1. However, if a FIFO18E1 occupies a Block RAM Tile, that tile can still accommodate a RAMB18E1
