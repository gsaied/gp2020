2. Memory

|     Site Type     | Used | Fixed | Available | Util% |
+-------------------+------+-------+-----------+-------+
| Block RAM Tile    |   98 |     0 |      1470 |  6.67 |
|   RAMB36/FIFO*    |   98 |     0 |      1470 |  6.67 |

* Note: Each Block RAM Tile only has one FIFO logic available and therefore can accommodate only one FIFO36E1 or one FIFO18E1. However, if a FIFO18E1 occupies a Block RAM Tile, that tile can still accommodate a RAMB18E1
